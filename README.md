### Following are the steps to run the word count:

1. To begin with, create a repo on github.com and clone it to your system. Now, install go from the link (https://go.dev/dl/) and verify its version.
2. Once go is succesfully installed on your system, create a beam-go directory in your 44517 folder.
3. Now, execute the command:
   * go mod init github.com/githubusername/beam-go
4. Now, install go SDK, install the word count program and run it usig the following commands in gitbash:
   * go get -u github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/pkg/beam
   * go install github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/examples/wordcount
   * wordcount --input <sample.txt> --output s541988Aneela
5. Once you run these commands and output file named s541988Aneela will be created.
### Bonus: 
1. I have opened the beam-go directory in vs code, and manually created a file hello.go
2. As mentioned in the instructions, I have run someone else's custom hello.go program hosted in their GitHub and the link to their custom hello.go is:
   * https://github.com/Padmini6699/beam-go/blob/main/hello.go
